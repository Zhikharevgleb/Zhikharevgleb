# Hello!

My name is **Gleb Alexandrovich Zhikharev**, and I am a novice IT professional.

My primary education background is in law. Currently, I am a third-year student at the *Ural State Law University*. Over time, I realized that law does not align with my career goals and professional ambitions, prompting me to change direction.

I am currently enrolled in the *Sberbank's "School 21"* program, learning modern PTP methodologies. During my studies, I have gained solid knowledge of the **C programming language** and developed skills in working with **relational databases**. I have honed soft skills such as independently solving non-standard tasks and effectively collaborating with colleagues on project work. Alongside my studies, I have been learning **Python**, which I have already applied in my previous legal job for automating document workflows, and I have also acquired the basics of **Golang**.

I am focused on active development and professional growth, ready to tackle new challenges and engage in productive collaboration.

Best regards,  
Gleb Alexandrovich Zhikharev
