    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Gleb Alexandrovich Zhikharev</strong>, and I am a novice IT professional.</p>

    <p>My primary education background is in law. Currently, I am a third-year student at the <em>Ural State Law
            University</em>. Over time, I realized that law does not align with my career goals and professional
        ambitions, prompting me to change direction.</p>

    <p>I am currently enrolled in the <em>Sberbank's "School 21"</em> program, learning modern PTP methodologies. During
        my studies, I have gained solid knowledge of the <strong>C programming language</strong> and developed skills in
        working with <strong>relational databases</strong>. I have honed soft skills such as independently solving
        non-standard tasks and effectively collaborating with colleagues on project work. Alongside my studies, I have
        been learning <strong>Python</strong>, which I have already applied in my previous legal job for automating
        document workflows, and I have also acquired the basics of <strong>Golang</strong>.</p>

    <p>I am focused on active development and professional growth, ready to tackle new challenges and engage in
        productive collaboration.</p>

    <p>Best regards,<br>
        Gleb Alexandrovich Zhikharev</p>
